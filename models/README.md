Recently (May 2021), I investigated the existing 3D medical image segmentation algorithm based on U-Net and found that the models designed in [MICCAI-LITS2017](https://github.com/assassint2017/MICCAI-LITS2017) and [KiU-Net](https://github.com/jeya-maria-jose/KiU-Net-pytorch) are perfect. I recommend that you pay attention to these two projects. Rewriting the model file was a waste of time, so I deleted the previous model and referenced some of their work, and then made minor modifications. Thank you very much for these two open source projects.
